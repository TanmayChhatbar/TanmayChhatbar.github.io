Topics such as vehicle dynamics, classic controls concepts, and controls fundamentals will be covered during the interview
Some conversational questions during the interview might be:
    What previous work or project have you completed which would be relevant and why?
        i see n main intersections between my experiences and the job description
        vehicle dynamics modeling and understanding. ive spent half my life thinking about cars 
        torque control algorithms for trajectory maintenance (DO14)
        firmware/integration engineers - can read and write basic code in C/C++
        calibration - extensive experience in sensor selection and calibration for data collection 
        analysis tools - extensive experience in writing script to analyse and automate the analysis for repeated testing
      
    What are some of the hardest problems you've had to solve? How did you examine it before proceeding?
        speed control for DO14 vehicle
        issues with fbk control
        hence used ff+fbk control
        seems straightforward to think about it, but it is involved
            understanding the vehicle's dynamics and modeling those forces
            unlike a car tyre, skid-steer research is not as well standardized
            models that exist are primarily used for design and development, and are expensive and have many, many parameters
            a simplified steady state map that relates the desired output to a required input is needed
            this map needs to mimic the real vehicle's response
            vehicle testing for data collection
            data collection 
            etc
        ultimate goal with this research on skid-steered vehicles in general is 
            to estimate the 4 parameters that define the feedforward map in real-time to adapt to changing surfaces

    Why do you want to work at Tesla?
        i spoke with a few engineers and ex interns at tesla
        close-knit development between all teams
            i am not limited to just one of my skills
            can leverage my knowledge in different domains to improve the product
            i can learn more about a variety of subjects quicker, by doing
        innnovation
        willingness and acceptance of new ideas
        freedom to explore alternate solutions

Q - how do you sense the torque/force on the steering rack with a motor?

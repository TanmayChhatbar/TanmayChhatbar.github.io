                    I learnt how to use blender, the software out of interest.<br>This short clip serves to showcase my skills in modelling and animation as a submission for one of the certified courses on a MOOC that taught blender.<br><br>All animations on this page, and their assets have been modelled, textured and rendered by me.

                    For this render, I took an untextured asset from the internet. All textures are procedurally generated, except the logos.<br>I modelled and textured the custom tyre model based on the motorcycle I owned, as well as an Akra exhaust.<br>The project was rendered in cycles.

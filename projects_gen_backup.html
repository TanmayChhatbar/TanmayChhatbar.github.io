                <p class="info">
                    As a challenge, I engineered a datalogger for my car to collect inertial and GPS data while participating in AutoX events.<br>The result was this ESP32-based device, for which more information can be found on <a style="color:grey" href="https://github.com/TanmayChhatbar/car_datalogger" target="_blank"><u>GitHub</u></a>.<br><br><u>TTGO TS 1.4</u> ESP32-based board, with built-in <u>MPU9250 IMU</u> and a microSD card reader, was used.<br><u>Adafruit Ultimate GPS</u> module is used to get GPS data.<br>Inertial data is collected at around 300Hz, GPS data is collected at 5Hz.

					<br><br>The aircraft fuselage was designed and manufactured to be as light as possible, with a maximum payload capacity of <u>42 golf balls</u>. The balsa-wood wings were designed to be light, and yet capable of withstanding the payload weight high-g aerial maneuvers.
